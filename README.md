Getting up and running.

- In this order:
npx expo install
npx expo prebuild

- To install expo on the simulator 
npx react-native run-ios


- Ran these at some point:
npx expo run:[android|ios]  
eas build  
npm install -g eas-cli  
npx expo install expo-dev-client

- Fun Expo things to keep in mind
installing some dependencies (like local storage) require you to uninstall the expo app from the simulator and re run 'npx react-native run-ios'
